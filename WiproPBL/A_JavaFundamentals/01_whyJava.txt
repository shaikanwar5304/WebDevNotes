----PLATFORM INDEPENDENT----

Previous Problem (No Java):
    Developers write code for projects (e.g., in C or C++).
    When they need to distribute or monetize the project, they face two options:
        Share the compiled executable file:
            This requires separate coding for different systems due to hardware and OS dependencies.
        Share the source code:
            Reduces the effort of coding for each platform but risks exposing algorithms or ideas, raising
            intellectual     property concerns (IPR).
    Therefore, developers often need to develop separate versions of the project for each platform.


What Java Did:
    Java introduced a solution through three stages:
        Writing the code.
        Compiling into bytecode.
        Running the bytecode on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
    The bytecode runs on any machine with a JVM of the same version.
    This eliminates the need to write separate code for each platform, simplifying cross-platform development.
